Recipient: To The Director/Secretary, [Name of Relevant Government Department/Body, e.g., Directorate of Collegiate Education, Government of Tamil Nadu]

Subject: Urgent Complaint Regarding Non-Observance of Official Government Holiday (Bakrid - June 6, 2025) by [Your College Name]

Body:
"Respected Sir/Madam,

This complaint is being filed anonymously on behalf of the student body of [Your College Name, Full Address of College, including district and PIN code]. We are deeply concerned and aggrieved by the college management's decision to compel students to attend a full-day 'placement training program' today, June 6, 2025.

It is a well-known fact and officially declared by the Government of Tamil Nadu that June 6, 2025, is a public holiday on account of Bakrid (Eid al-Adha). We respectfully attach the relevant Government Order (G.O.) notification as evidence.

Despite this official declaration, the entire [Your Department Name, e.g., 'Computer Science Engineering Department'] and the college management are forcing students to attend classes/training today. This is a clear violation of the government's holiday directive and is causing significant distress and inconvenience to students who wish to observe the holiday.

We urge your esteemed office to investigate this matter urgently and take appropriate action against the college management for this non-compliance. We request that the college be directed to observe all official government holidays and compensate students for working on a declared holiday.

We are compelled to file this complaint anonymously due to fear of academic and disciplinary repercussions from the college administration, as there is no support from other students.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this serious matter.

Sincerely,
[Leave blank, or write "A Concerned Student"]"
