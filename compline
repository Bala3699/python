Subject: Urgent Complaint Regarding Non-Observance of Official Government Holiday (Bakrid - June 6, 2025) by [Your College Name]

Body:
"Respected Sir/Madam,

This complaint is being filed anonymously on behalf of the student body of [Your College Name, Full Address of College, including district and PIN code]. We are deeply concerned and aggrieved by the college management's decision to compel students to attend a full-day 'placement training program' today, June 6, 2025.

It is a well-known fact and officially declared by the Government of Tamil Nadu that June 6, 2025, is a public holiday on account of Bakrid (Eid al-Adha). We respectfully attach the relevant Government Order (G.O.) notification as evidence.

Despite this official declaration, the entire [Your Department Name, e.g., 'Computer Science Engineering Department'] and the college management are forcing students to attend classes/training today. This is a clear violation of the government's holiday directive and is causing significant distress and inconvenience to students who wish to observe the holiday.

We urge your esteemed office to investigate this matter urgently and take appropriate action against the college management for this non-compliance. We request that the college be directed to observe all official government holidays and compensate students for working on a declared holiday.

We are compelled to file this complaint anonymously due to fear of academic and disciplinary repercussions from the college administration, as there is no support from other students.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this serious matter.

Sincerely,
[Leave blank, or write "A Concerned Student"]"

Subject: Urgent Anonymous Complaint: College Mandating "Placement Training" on Public Holiday (Bakrid) - June 6 & 7, 2025 - Verbal Orders & Fine Threat

To: rjdcechennai@gmail.com

Dear Regional Joint Director,

I am writing to file an anonymous and urgent complaint regarding [Your College Name], located in Padur, Chennai.

The college management has verbally mandated a full working day for students today, June 6, 2025, and also for tomorrow, June 7, 2025. This is being enforced under the pretext of a "placement training program."

It is critical to note that June 7, 2025, is officially observed as Bakrid (Eid al-Adha), a gazetted public holiday in Tamil Nadu. The college has provided no official email, message, or circular regarding these working days. Instead, students have been informed verbally that attendance is compulsory, and a fine of â‚¹1000 will be collected for any absence.

This lack of official communication, combined with the threat of a hefty fine, appears to be a deliberate attempt to circumvent regulations and coerce students into attending on a public holiday. Using a "placement training program" as justification to compel students to attend college on a public holiday is a blatant violation of public holiday regulations and a profound disregard for student rights.

This directive places an unreasonable burden on students, denying them their rightful observance of an important religious and public holiday, and disrupting personal and family commitments.

We strongly urge your office to immediately investigate this matter, specifically the alleged "placement training program" on a public holiday and the verbal threats of fines without official notification. Please take decisive action against the college management for this deliberate violation of public holiday norms and unethical practices. We appeal for our anonymity to be strictly protected to prevent any potential negative repercussions from the college administration.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this critical issue.

Sincerely,

A Concerned Student
