# Python C
A **tuple** is an ordered and immutable collection of elements. Tuples are very similar to lists but cannot be changed after creation.

## Creating Tuples

# Creating a tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4)
print("Tuple:", my_tuple)

# Creating a tuple without parentheses
another_tuple = 5, 6, 7
print("Tuple without parentheses:", another_tuple)

# Single element tuple (with comma)
single_tuple = (10,)
print("Single element tuple:", single_tuple)
## Accessing Elements
print("First element:", my_tuple[0])
print("Last element:", my_tuple[-1])
## Tuple Operations
# Concatenation
t1 = (1, 2)
t2 = (3, 4)
print("Concatenated Tuple:", t1 + t2)

# Repetition
print("Repeated Tuple:", t1 * 3)
## Tuple Methods
sample_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2)
print("Count of 2:", sample_tuple.count(2))
print("Index of 3:", sample_tuple.index(3))
## Immutability
Tuples cannot be changed after creation. Attempting to change elements will result in an error.
# Uncommenting the below line will cause an error
# my_tuple[0] = 100
