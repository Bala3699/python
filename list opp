# Question 1
# Write a Python program that performs the following operations on a list:

### 1. Create a list of integers: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

### 2. Append the number 60 to the list.

### 3. Remove the second element from the list.

### 4. Insert the number 25 at the second position.

### 5. Sort the list in descending order.

### 6. Find the length of the list.

### 7. Access the last element in the list without using a negative index.

# 1. Create a list of integers
ex_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
print("Initial list:", ex_list)

# 2. Append the number 60 to the list
ex_list.append(60)
print("After appending 60:", ex_list)

# 3. Remove the second element (index 1)
ex_list.pop(1)
print("After removing the second element:", ex_list)

# 4. Insert the number 25 at the second position (index 1)
ex_list.insert(1, 25)
print("After inserting 25 at the second position:", ex_list)

# 5. Sort the list in descending order
ex_list.sort(reverse=True)
print("List sorted in descending order:", ex_list)

# 6. Find the length of the list
list_length = len(ex_list)
print("Length of the list:", list_length)


print(ex_list[-1])
''' 
last_element = ex_list[5]
print("Last element in the list:", last_element)
'''

# Question 2:
## Create a list of fruits 
## "apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry". Perform the following operations:

### 1. Count how many times "banana" appears in the list.
### 2. Extend the list by adding the elements from another list ["fig", "grape"].
### 3. Reverse the list.
### 4. Find the index of "cherry".
### 5.Remove "date" from the list.
# 1. Create a list of fruits
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]

# 2. Count how many times "banana" appears in the list
banana_count = fruits.count("banana")
print("Count of 'banana':", banana_count)

# 3. Extend the list with another list
fruits.extend(["fig", "grape"])
print("After extending the list:", fruits)

# 4. Reverse the list
fruits.reverse()
print("Reversed list:", fruits)

# 5. Find the index of "cherry"
cherry_index = fruits.index("cherry")
print("Index of 'cherry':", cherry_index)

# 6. Remove "date" from the list
fruits.remove("date")
print("After removing 'date':", fruits)

# Question 3:
# Create a list of integers 15, 25, 35, 45, 55 
# and perform the following operations:

### 1. Insert the number 30 at the third position.
### 2. Sort the list in ascending order.
### 3. Make a copy of the list.
### 4. Clear all elements from the original list.
### 5. Check if the copied list still has the elements.
# 1. Create a list of integers
numbers = [15, 25, 35, 45, 55]

# 2. Insert the number 30 at the third position (index 2)
numbers.insert(2, 30)
print("After inserting 30 at third position:", numbers)

# 3. Sort the list in ascending order
numbers.sort()
print("Sorted list:", numbers)

# 4. Make a copy of the list
numbers_copy = numbers.copy()
print("Copy of the list:", numbers_copy)

# 5. Clear the original list
numbers.clear()
print("Original list after clearing:", numbers)

# 6. Check if the copied list still has elements
print("Copied list:", numbers_copy)


# Question 4:
# Create a list "cat", "dog", "elephant", "horse". 
# Perform the following operations:

### 1. Add "tiger" to the end of the list using a list method.
### 2. Remove the first element of the list.
### 3. Create a list of numbers and find the maximum, minimum, and sum of the list [100, 200, 300, 400].
### 4. Check if "dog" is in the list.
### 5. Sort the animal list alphabetically.
# 1. Create a list of animals
animals = ["cat", "dog", "elephant", "horse"]

# 2. Add "tiger" to the end of the list
animals.append("tiger")
print("After appending 'tiger':", animals)

# 3. Remove the first element of the list
animals.pop(0)
print("After removing the first element:", animals)

# 4. Create a list of numbers and find the max, min, and sum
numbers = [100, 200, 300, 400]
max_number = max(numbers)
min_number = min(numbers)
sum_numbers = sum(numbers)
print(f"Max: {max_number}, Min: {min_number}, Sum: {sum_numbers}")

# 5. Check if "dog" is in the list
is_dog_in_list = "dog" in animals
print("Is 'dog' in the list:", is_dog_in_list)

# 6. Sort the animal list alphabetically
animals.sort()
print("Sorted list of animals:", animals)
